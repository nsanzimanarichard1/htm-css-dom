<h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
  
</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</p></li>
      <li><p>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks</p>
      <p>to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></li>
      <li><p>Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian</p>
      <p>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed</p>
      <p>them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget</p>
        <p>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under</p>
        <p>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is</p>
        <p>rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT</p>
        <p>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his</p>
        <p>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.</p>
        <p>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease</p>
        <p>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling</p>
        <p>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to</p>
        <p>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian</p>
        <p>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly</p>
        <p>expanding population</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and</p>
        <p>sorghum yields</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues</p>
        <p>that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as</p>
        <p>we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous</p>
        <p>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long</p>
        <p>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</p>
      </li>
